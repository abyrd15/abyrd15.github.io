                    <p> I study how the legacies of literacy for liberation and humanity carry forward into new technologies and media features. To this end, I learn how racially marginalized people create their own means for transformative access using computer technologies. My approach is qualitative: interviewing community members, participating in community members’ events, collecting artifacts meaningful to their lives, and honoring their voices through writing. My book manuscript The Literacy Pivot: How Black Adults Learn Computer Programming in a Racist World is based on a year-long ethnographic study on Black adults attending Clearwater Academy to learn computer programming for a potential career in tech. I show that students learn how to labor with computer programming, not learning computer programming. In doing so, Black adults reshape their relationship with labor and coding literacy in ways that do not align with the goals of computer code bootcamps. The book is under contract with The WAC Clearinghouse / The University Press of Colorado. As a complete the book manuscript by the end of 2023, I've shifted my research agenda to artifical intelligence and writing, graduate education pedagogy, Black feminist care and assessment, and the working lives of coders doing contract work.

                                This study examines how African American adults attending a code bootcamp continue to learn coding literacy despite life challenges associated with racial oppression. suggest that participants use various clusters of support in their network to provide the personal resources coders need to code and what is hard to come by in situations of racial injustice. Instead of a universal approach to accessing technology, different kinds of networks and resources can lead to continuous access. This study furthers research on racially marginalized adults’ digital literacies and demonstrates how ego network analysis maybe useful for qualitative research on theories of ecological writing.

                                Some computer code bootcamps offer racially marginalized adults training in computer programming to assist in their social mobility. Many African American adults have little to no prior experience with programming. Literacy life history interviews show that the procedural literacy adult students practiced out of school scaffolded their learning coding literacy.
